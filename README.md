# What is this?

This is a verry small simple utility that allows you to track your water intake in cups. For the best accuracy please ensure you only use it on 1 device. You can use this anywhere but each device will have it's own record.

## How do I use this?

You open the URL and press the increment button. Each time you press it, 1 glass of water gets added to your total. When A new day starts, you might still see the record of the previous day. Don't worry, just click the button and it'll automaticly set the count as needed.
